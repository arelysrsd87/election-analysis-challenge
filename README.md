# Election-Audit Summary
- We propose modifying this code by analyzing how each candidate performed on each county. This will expand the versatibility of this code to be used for national elections to determine who won the popular vote on each county and state.
- Alternatively, the code can be modified by analyzing how each county contributed to each candidate's total vote. This will expand the versability of this code to be used by each candidate's campaign to see where their campaign perfomerd best.
